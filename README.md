## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is aims to identify the Customer Evasion Rate, from the telecommunications operator Alura Voz, in order to reduce it.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies 
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter.
* Nunphy

## Project Description
The data was obtained through the company's API and we were asked to analyze it to define the reasons for the high churn of customers. Thus, it was raised through the initial treatment of these data that the churm hypothesis may be coming from the . 

`-What hypothesis you are exploring. 
-What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? 
-What blockers and challenges are you facing?`

## Needs of this project
- Tips in data exploration/descriptive statistics
- Tips in processing/cleaning

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
